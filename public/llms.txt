# Two Weeks Game

> Two Weeks Game (TWG, твг) — community‑driven video‑game jam on the /gd/ board of Dvach (2ch.hk) since 2012. Participants submit a playable prototype ("demo") at the end of first week, then polish it into a final build by the end of second week.

Two Weeks Game is organized by volunteers (anyone on /gd/ can host), and runs twice a year (summer and winter). Over the years, TWG has grown in scale and lore, spawning sub‑contests, and a wealth of memes.
